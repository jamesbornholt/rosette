(provide server%)

; A server object manages the creation, use and shutdown of external processes.  
; The constructor takes as input two procedure: initializer and stderr-handler. 
; The initializer procedure takes no arguments and returns four values:  a new 
; process p, the standard output port for p, the standard input port for p, and 
; the standard error port for p.  The stderr-handler procedure takes an error 
; port for a process, reads one chunk of data from it, and handles it as desired.
; A server can be initialized and shutdown any number of times.  Calling initialize
; on a server that has already been initialized has no effect.
